 Seagate Firmware Download Utility.
 Copyright (c) 2016 Seagate Technology LLC, All Rights Reserved
 SeaFlashLin Version: 0.4.8
===============================================================================
Usage
=====
        seaflashlin -f <fw_file> -d <sg_device>
        seaflashlin {-m <model_number> -f <fw_file> | -c <cfs_file>} [-d <sg_device>]

Example
=======
Specific drive:
        seaflashlin -f test.lod -d /dev/sg0
        (defaults to segment size = 64 and timeout = 5 seconds)

Multiple drives:
        seaflashlin -c barracuda.cfs
        seaflashlin -m ST600MP0005

Control options
===============
        -i      Display identification information (list sg_devices)

        -d, --device deviceHandle
                Use this option to specify the sg device handle on which to
                perform an operation. Multiple device handles can be given.

                Example: -d /dev/sg5

        -f <fw_file>
                The name of the firmware file.

        -x <path>
                To designate alternate location of the firmware files.  Default
                is the current working directory.

        -c <cfs_file>   (SATA only)
                A Seagate-prepared compatible firmware selector file.  All
                drives is the system will be reviewed for new firmware based on
                this CFS file.

        -k <cfs_file>   (SATA only)
                "dry run" test to determine which files and drives are
                supported by a given CFS file.

        -m <model_number>
                The model number of the drive to download firmware. All drives
                is the system with this model number will be selected.  Use a
                CFS first if you have one instead of using this choice.

                Not recommended for batch updates to multiple SATA notebook or
                desktop drives because the model numbers are not exclusively
                defined for just one family.  In other words, two similar
                drives with the same model number may have different part
                numbers and will not share the same firmware file.

Modes and Controls
==================
        -e      Deferred download. Not common. (ATA only)
        -s      Segment size (1 segment = 512 bytes) Default is 64 (32KiB)
        -p      Force ATA passthrough (for SATA)
        -w      Force Write Buffer CMD (for SAS)
        -u      Non-segmented
        -o      Timeout value (seconds).  Default without this option is 5
                seconds.

Utility Options
===============
        -v      Display version and exit (overrides all other arguments)
        -l      Show license agreement

Return codes
============
        0       No error found
        1       Fatal error in command line options
        2       Firmware (FW) Download Failed
        3       Invalid device
        4       No match in CFS file (CFS file and SATA only)
        5       FW up to date (CFS file and SATA only)
        6       Model number mismatch (CFS file and SATA only)
        7       FW version mismatch (CFS file and SATA only)
        4x      Hexadecimal number count of Seagate sg devices in the
                system.  This response code is only returned by the -i
                system scan argument.  Beginning with 41 where x is the
                beginning of the count of the number of devices.
        Anything else = unknown error

================
Tool Usage Hints
================
First, run the -i option to determine what /dev/sg? assignment lines up to your
disk drive. This option will also show you other details about the drive
including the current firmware revision. Like this:

ATA       /dev/sg0 MN: ST94813AS            SN: 3AA043KP          FW: 3.03
SEAGATE   /dev/sg1 MN: ST1000NM0011         SN: ZAA15VAS          FW: SN03

==============================================
Batch Modes: SAS or SATA
==============================================
For SAS, -m is a model number verification based on the device Inquiry
response. -m mode scans all sg devices on the system, so it is -- in itself --
a batch mode. The -d switch may be used with -m to select a specific device.

   seaflashlin -m <model_number> -f <fw_file>

Note: Use of -m mode is preferred for batch processing of sg (SCSI generic) SAS
disk drives.  While the -m model checking mode works on SATA disk drives you
should be careful to have the exact right firmware file.  Unlike SAS disk
drives, some SATA drives may have less intelligence for checking improper
firmware download.  Damage might result from the attempted application of the
wrong firmware on some SATA drives.

For SATA, the -c <cfs_file> is a Seagate-prepared compatible firmware selector
file which is used to match up the right firmware for a particular SATA drive.
Use -k <cfs_file> to test which files and drives are supported by a given CFS
file.  No actual firmware download takes place with the "dry run" -k argument.

   seaflashlin -c <cfs_file>

Each /dev/sg device will be reviewed for applicable firmware download. Various
messages are displayed depending on the review results like:
   Downloading file SATA-filename.lod to /dev/sg0
   /dev/sg1 [CC49] does not match any entries in filename.cfs
   /dev/sg2 [CC4H] firmware is up to date

Note: Batch processing of SATA drives should use a Seagate prepared CFS file.

Both of these batch modes assume that the relevant firmware files are located
in the current working directory.

Alternately, these two batch modes may be targeted to a specific device like so:
   seaflashlin -m <model_number> -f <fw_file> -d </dev/sg#>
   seaflashlin -c <cfs_file> -d </dev/sg#>

By specifying -f and -d, without the benefit of requiring a model match with -m
or utilizing a Seagate -c .CFS file, you may still force a SATA download
attempt on any /dev/sg device regardless of type or suitability. Obviously,
this use is not recommended for most situations, but is available if needed.

Multiple devices can be defined like this:
   seaflashlin -f <fw_file> -d </dev/sg#> -d </dev/sg#> -d </dev/sg#>

=====================
More Tool Usage Hints
=====================
Enumeration (IDENT INFO) is a scan of all sg devices in the system.  Use the -i
option to determine what /dev/sg? assignment lines up to your disk drive. This
option will also show you other details about the drive including the current
firmware revision. Like this:

ATA       /dev/sg0 MN: ST94813AS            SN: 3AA043KP          FW: 3.03
SEAGATE   /dev/sg1 MN: ST1000NM0011         SN: ZAA15VAS          FW: SN03
Seagate   /dev/sg2 MN: Backup+  SL          SN: NA365TE8          FW: A905

You may use the --enum argument in the case of Seagate USB storage devices to
review the specific details of a hard disk drive within the USB enclosure.
This is sometimes called the child drive.  The above example /dev/sg2 would
change to this display with --enum:

ATA       /dev/sg0 MN: ST94813AS            SN: 3AA043KP          FW: 3.03
SEAGATE   /dev/sg1 MN: ST1000NM0011         SN: ZAA15VAS          FW: SN03
Seagate   /dev/sg2 MN: ST1500LM HN-M151RAD  SN: S326J9ADC07171    FW: 2BC10001

The seaflashlin default segment size is 64 when not specified on the command
line.

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.

The -e Deferred SATA download is not supported by many drives as of 2013. Usage
is expected to increase over time.  The Deferred download stores the new
firmware in a temporary location on the drive and does not actually update the
firmware until the next power reset.

The -u Non-segmented download requires more memory which may or may not be
available to the sg driver. In some cases Linux will try and fail but the sg
driver may not generate any error.

Tests which alter the firmware or erase user data on the drive are limited to
Seagate-only products which include Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie.

===================
General Usage Hints
===================
The tool will require root privileges to run using either sudo or su commands.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that Linux file names and command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Display a file listing with the Linux command: ls -lah

A dot slash is a dot followed immediately by a forward slash (./). It is used
in Linux to execute a compiled program in the current directory when it is not
a built-in command or found in your path.
For example, ./seaflashlin -f test.lod -d /dev/sg0

Shut down the files system and remove the power with the command:
poweroff

See previous screen history with the key combination:
shift+pgup or shift+pgdn

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.
For example,
seaflashlin -f test.lod -d /dev/sg0 | tee -a myTestLog.txt

Display a log or text file with the Linux "less" command: less myfile.log
Press the letter q to quit displaying the file.  Similarly, you can easily
read the Seagate License agreement by piping the output to the less
command with seaflashlin -l |less

Display a list of sg (SCSI generic) devices with the command:
cat /sys/class/scsi_generic/sg*/device/model
or
ls /dev/sg*

sg devices include the following interfaces: SATA, USB, SCSI (SCSI, SAS and FC)

When drives are not detected by SeaFlashLin
-------------------------------------------
The problem is that the sg driver isn't loaded on the system on boot.  You can
test if it is loaded by doing "ls /dev/sg*" and see if anything shows up. If
nothing shows up then the SG driver is missing (which is required by
SeaFlashLin to issue commands).

You need to do "modprobe sg" as root to load the sg module (since it wasn't
compiled into the kernel), then you will get sg devices that we can scan and
find. Once you run the modprobe command and sg is successfully loaded, then you
can re-run "ls /dev/sg*" and see SG device nodes. SeaFlashLin should then be
able to find devices once again.

========================
Raw Firmware Data Files
========================
You will need the Seagate firmware file to run the simple command line Linux
tool. This file will have the .LOD filename extension and should be located in
the current working directory. This firmware file should never be used outside
of the specific product family models and part numbers listed with the firmware
release. Incorrect usage of the .LOD may result in data loss or even product
failure. Seagate Technology is not responsible for lost user data. See the End
User License Agreement below for specific information about these software
tools.

For your convenience, a copy of the seaflashlin firmware download utility is
saved in the directory named 'linux cli tools'.  You may use this with your
native Linux OS.  Be sure to follow all cautions and backup all important data
before attempting to download firmware to the hard disk drive.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
